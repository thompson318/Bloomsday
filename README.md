Inspired by a favourite passage from Ulysses, it's a multi-sensory, interactive, tribute to water and to the writing of James Joyce. Ocean sounds accompany 
the original text with interactive ripple effects (depending on your web browser). In the background the text is read by multiple voices, best listened to in stereo. You may find it soothing, you may find it inspiring, or you may find it annoying. If you like you can contribute your own reading of a line of the text, to be incorporated into the finished webpage.

I'd like to add human voices, to create a collaboration between humans and machines. 
At the time of writing the text is read mainly by machine, [pico2wave](https://www.openhab.org/addons/voice/picotts/), with stereo effects added using
[ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/). To add your voice to the mix please pick a line from those below, record yourself reading it and send it by [email](mailto:s.thompson@ucl.ac.uk) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=stevedoscience). All recordings will be released under a [creative commons 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If multiple voices are available for the same line, then one voice is randomly picked on each repeat run. You can turn off the human voices with the html option ?nohumans

Some technical stuff
--------------------
By the powers of WebGL, add a layer of water to your HTML elements which will ripple by cursor interaction!

Important: this plugin requires the WebGL extension `OES_texture_float` (and `OES_texture_float_linear` for a better effect).

Options
-------
| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| imageUrl | string | null | The URL of the image to use as the background. If absent the plugin will attempt to use the value of the computed `background-image` CSS property instead. Data-URIs are accepted as well. |
| dropRadius | float | 20 | The size (in pixels) of the drop that results by clicking or moving the mouse over the canvas. |
| perturbance | float | 0.03 | Basically the amount of refraction caused by a ripple. 0 means there is no refraction. |
| resolution | integer | 256 | The width and height of the WebGL texture to render to. The larger this value, the smoother the rendering and the slower the ripples will propagate. |
| interactive | bool | true | Whether mouse clicks and mouse movement triggers the effect. |
| crossOrigin | string | "" | The crossOrigin attribute to use for the affected image. For more information see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/CORS_settings_attributes).


Methods
-------
### drop
Call `$(selector).ripples('drop', x, y, radius, strength)` to manually add a drop at the element's relative coordinates (x, y). `radius` controls the drop's size and `strength` the amplitude of the resulting ripple.

### destroy
Call `$(selector).ripples('destroy')` to remove the effect from the element.

### hide / show
Call `.ripples('hide')` and `.ripples('show')` to toggle the effect's visibility. Hiding it will also effectively pause the simulation.

### pause / play
Call `$(selector).ripples('pause')` and `.ripples('play')` to toggle the simulation's state.

### set
Call `$(selector).ripples('set', name, value)` to update properties of the effect. The properties that can be updated are:
- `dropRadius`
- `perturbance`
- `interactive`
- `imageUrl` (setting the image URL will update the background image used for the effect, but the `background-image` CSS property will be untouched)
- `crossOrigin` (setting this won't have any effect until `imageUrl` is changed)

### updateSize
The effect resizes automatically when the width or height of the window changes. When the dimensions of the element changes, you need to call `$(selector).ripples('updateSize')` to update the size of the effect accordingly.
